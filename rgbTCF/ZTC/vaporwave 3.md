Using the same method as 1 and 2 we use spectrogram stuffs to get chunks of text in each audio clip
using briefing hints (and guessing) we sort these by decreasing time length to get a string:
`janOHS{ahse0n1yz_k4f73p}`

We then guess vigenere and uh after some trial and error (and using the flag format as a guide) i got a partial key of "summon", so i just guessed the key was `summoningsalt` by the theme and also the briefing to get the flag.

#### flag: rgbCTF{summ0n1ng_s4l73d}
