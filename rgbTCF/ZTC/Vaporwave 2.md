# Vaporwave 2

We get two audio tracks.

One of them has a message about turntables in base64 in the spectogram, which seems kinda useless.

So to get the difference between the tracks, I inverted track one, then used audacity to mix and render the two to a new track (effectively subtracting track1 from track2) giving us the flag in a spectogram.
