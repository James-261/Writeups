# Vaporwave1

I had no clue, so thought of a ton of things, eventually coming back to some physics lessons with waves.

We can use a spectrum analyser to see "the magnitude of an input signal vs frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument". I used spek \(spek.cc\) to do that, and it loads in the flag.

## Flag: rgbCTF{s331ng\_s0undz}
