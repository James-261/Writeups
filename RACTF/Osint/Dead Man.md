# Dead Man

I searched 'war memorial cross' and scrolled through images.

I eventually found one that looked similar to the one in the photo.

It was a 'cross of sacrifice'. 

However there is quite a few of them in many countries. 

Woa managed to identify the country from some blurred writing in the back ground (Thailand).

From searching thailand cross of sacrifice I managed to find the place it was in and able to submit the flag.
