# C0llide

We pass in two values which are passed into a hashing algorithm and hashed. 

If they match, we get the flag. But the values we give cannot match when compared with ===
So i was just playing around and,

`{"one":["aa"], "two":["aa"]}`

Type juggling or something, I guess lists are different objects in memory so aren't ===, but get expanded out??? no idea
Anyway
