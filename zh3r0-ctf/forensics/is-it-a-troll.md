So download the jpg.

Run exiftool and the author data is base62 encoded.

Decode it to get itrolledyou which you can run on steghide to get a zip.

Unzip dat zip bitch and you find a .png.

Run zsteg and you'll get `30:aDutCu4gwUtnqdVuhLUL6jFueSgRFi`. No idea what the 30: is but remove that and decode the remaining thing.

Its base58 encoded. After that you get the flag but replace the 'o's with '0's.

## Flag: zh3r0{y0u\_g0t\_th3\_k3y}
