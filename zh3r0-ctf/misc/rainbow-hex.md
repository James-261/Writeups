# Rainbow Hex

Immediately \(Thanks Tom from RTCP!\) I spotted that it was hexahue, but it was moving at too fast a pace to transcribe manually.

So, I split the video into frames, and just manually converted the hexahue to text.

\(had to guess a couple of things here and there, but it was mostly fine\)
