# Trailing Bits

So because of the bit removals, relative to the byte each bit position is off by 2 - we can correct this by removing 2 bits at the beginning so that the binary decrypts to valid plaintext, which contains the flag CCTF{it5\_3n0u9h\_jU5T\_tO\_sH1ft\_M3}

## Flag: CCTF{it5\_3n0u9h\_jU5T\_tO\_sH1ft\_M3}
