So, for this challenge, we need to set the "member" parameter in the json to something that is not 0, ideally 1. idk all the techincal stuff but i just tried to inject stuff into the json Since we still need valid json for it to work, I first gave the name a junk value, and then closed the quote, created a new member parameter, gave it the value 1, and then finally created a random parameter with a junk value to make sure it was valid json. Final payload \(just use this as a username\) `hi","member":1,"hi":"hi`

which gets you the flag: flag{t0ny\_5uck5\_47\_w3b\_l0l}

## Flag: flag{1\_c4nt\_f1nd\_4\_g00d\_p4nd4\_pun}
