# Writeup Specs

When uploading writeups,  


use '# ' for the title  


use '#### ' for the flag  


If you want a line break, do a double space


If there is any code, do the same big quote thing for discord and then with the language you want after it, like [3 backticks]python and remember to close after  


Also remember to add file extension .md


#### This is a flag example :p
