# Romance Dawn

After looking around in the file (raw) i noticed there wasn't an IDAT header and instead found an EASY header so i just renamed it. however, only half of the image was complete so i looked down to around where the image breaks (took some time) and found another EASY header and did the same thing. i suspected it was replace so i control + f for EASY and replaced them all with IDAT.
