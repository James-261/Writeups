# Rainbow Hex

Immediately (Thanks Tom from RTCP!) I spotted that it was hexahue, 
but it was moving at too fast a pace to transcribe manually. 

So, I split the video into frames, and just manually converted the hexahue to text. 

(had to guess a couple of things here and there, but it was mostly fine)
