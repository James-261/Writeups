# Tree Man

We can see a Spanish Flag in the background,

and then we can simply google "Spain Tree Man",

which gives us the location of the theme park.

We then look for the structure present in the background,

\(the orange rocks\) and then using a bit of Google Maps precision stuff, we can get the location pretty accurately
