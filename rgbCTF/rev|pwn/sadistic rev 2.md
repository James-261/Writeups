# sadistic rev 2

i honestly dont know it was a mix of bruteforcing the first 32 bytes and then something something IDK OK DONT FUKCIANDOFAJSLDFASDJFL

So since the program will not accept input less than 32
I bruteforced the first 32 bytes
And then i realised if i put the start of that at the end it gives stuff So my input became
`32494328fdsajsfkl}rgbCTF{hopeful32494328fdsajsfkl}`
And then i bruteforced from the start again until i got the flag.

# flag: rgbCTF{hopefully_this_was_harder32494328fdsajsfkl}
