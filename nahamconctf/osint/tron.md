# Tron

\(haha maltego go brrr\) because i felt like it i just `https://instantusername.com/#/` and searched for `NahamConTron` i found that he had a github account, so i went on there and looked at his commits he has a repo called dotfiles, and JohnHammond has committed there `https://github.com/NahamConTron/dotfiles/commit/db31fa2e124443a7da945844ba2b59700eea0094`

this has an ssh key, and also the ip, user and port of the server. if we connect \(make sure to `chmod 700` the key before connecting\), we can see a file called flag.txt, and catting it gives us the flag

## flag: flag{nahamcon\_is\_on\_the\_grid} \(or somethin\)
